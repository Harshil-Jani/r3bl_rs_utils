# r3bl_rs_utils

This crate provides utility functions that are inspired by Kotlin scope functions and a host of
capabilities to make it easier to build TUIs (Text User Interface apps) in Rust.

The equivalent of this library is available for TypeScript and is called
[r3bl-ts-utils](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-ts-utils/).
