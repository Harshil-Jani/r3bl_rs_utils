//! This module contains:
//! 1. [`arena`] - a non-binary tree implementation that is thread safe.
//! 2. [`mt_arena`] - a variant of the tree that supports parallel tree walking.
//!
//! ðŸ’¡ You can learn more about how this library was built from this [developerlife.com
//! article](https://developerlife.com/2022/02/24/rust-non-binary-tree/).
//!
//! ðŸ“œ There are more complex ways of using this `Arena`. Please look at these extensive integration
//! tests that put the `Arena` API thru its paces
//! [here](https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-rs-utils/blob/main/tests/tree_memory_arena_test.rs).
