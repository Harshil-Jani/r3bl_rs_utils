//! This library provides utility functions:
//!  1. Thread safe asynchronous Redux library (uses Tokio to run subscribers
//! and middleware in     separate tasks). The reducer functions are run in
//! sequence (not in Tokio tasks).  2. Declarative macros, and procedural macros
//! (both function like and derive) to avoid     having to write lots of
//! boilerplate code for many common (and complex) tasks.  3. Non binary tree
//! data structure inspired by memory arenas, that is thread safe and
//!     supports parallel tree walking.
//!  4. Functions to unwrap deeply nested objects inspired by Kotlin scope
//! functions.  5. Capabilities to make it easier to build TUIs (Text User
//! Interface apps) in Rust. This     is currently experimental and is being
//! actively developed.
